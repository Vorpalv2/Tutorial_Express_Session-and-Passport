This tutorial demonstrates how to implement user authentication using Passport.js and Express sessions with a MongoDB database and EJS templating engine. Users can register and login, and their credentials are securely stored in MongoDB.

Key Features --

Authentication: Local username/password authentication using Passport.js.
Database: Stores user credentials and other relevant data in MongoDB.
Sessions: Maintains user state throughout their browsing session with Express sessions.
Frontend: User-friendly registration and login forms using EJS templates.
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
MongoDB database up and running
Basic understanding of Express, Passport.js, and EJS
Tutorial Overview
Project Setup:
Create a new Node.js project and initialize it with npm.
Install required dependencies: express, express-session, mongoose, body-parser, passport, passport-local, ejs.
Connect to your MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Authentication Setup:
Configure Passport.js with a local strategy and set up password hashing.
Implement user registration and login routes with Passport authentication.
Serialize and deserialize user data for session management.
Frontend Integration:
Create EJS templates for registration and login forms.
Use EJS to render dynamic content based on user authentication status.
Run the Application:
Start the Node.js server and access the application in your browser.
Register a new user and test the login functionality.
Additional Notes
This tutorial provides a basic example. You can extend it with features like email verification, password reset, or social logins.
Ensure secure password storage using hashing and salting techniques.
Consider implementing best practices for session management and security.
